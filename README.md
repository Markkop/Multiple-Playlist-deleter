# ðŸŽ¶ Multiple Playlist Deleter

![Demo image](https://multiple-playlist-deleter-markkop.vercel.app/ogimage.jpeg)

I've been a long-time user of [mixkeepr](https://mixkeepr.com/) for saving my weekly music recommendations. However, I ended up with a lot of unused playlists and was unable to delete them all at once using Spotify.

To solve this problem, I created a tool with the help of AI to delete multiple playlists easily.

## Demo

https://multiple-playlist-deleter-markkop.vercel.app/

## Usage

1. Click the "Authorize Multiple Playlist Deleter" link to authenticate with your Spotify account.
2. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to the app logged in.
3. Click the "Load Playlists" button to fetch your playlists.
4. Select the playlists you want to delete by clicking on them.
5. Click the "Delete Selected Playlists" button to delete the selected playlists.
